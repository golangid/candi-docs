# API (definition of APIs)

API folder inside service is the definition of your APIs such as :

- <a href="#/service/jsonschema/">JSONSchema</a> to validate api request.
- <a href="#/service/graphql/">GraphQL</a> query files.
- <a href="#/service/grpc/">GRPC</a> proto files.

**For REST service, jsonschema, graphql and grpc is not required**
